                <h2>&#128241;iPhone 12 review: One of our highest-rated phones of all time</h2>
                <img src="./img/iPhone.png" alt="" class="blog_content_img">
                <p><b>The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro</b> mark the beginning of a new generation of <b>iPhone.</b> Support for 5G, a new hardware design and
                camera improvements are a significant step away from the iPhone X generation of devices. This is nothing new. Apple did
                something similar in 2010 with the iPhone 4 and in 2014 when it released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
                <p>There is one <b>big difference with the iPhone 12</b> generation, though. It's the first time there are four new iPhones at
                once: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. If you want to go small and reap the benefits
                of a lower price there's the Mini. If you want the biggest iPhone with the newest in iPhone cameras, <b>get the Pro Max.</b></p>
                <p>But that leaves the 12 and 12 Pro which are similar (like basically-the-same-phone similar). That's not necessarily a
                bad thing. Now there are many people who will just get the iPhone 12 because it doesn't cost a thousand dollars and it's a great
                phone. Which it is. And there are many people who will get the iPhone 12 Pro because it is more premium. Which it is.
                Either way, you're getting <b>an amazing phone</b> with the best overall camera system you can find.

                <h2>&#8986;Best Apple Watch: the ultimate guide to pick your iPhone compatible smartwatch</h2>
                <img src="./img/iWatch.png" alt="" class="blog_content_img">
                <p>There’s a lot to consider when shopping for <b>the best Apple Watch</b>. The Apple Watch 6, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch 3
                are all available direct from Apple, while a number of other models can still be found elsewhere, so there’s no shortage
                of choice, and that’s before you consider the different straps, sizes, and shades available.
                The good news is that all of the available options are great wearables, so you can’t go too wrong, but the best Apple
                Watch for you won’t necessarily be the best for everyone. For example, while <b>the top-end tech of the Apple Watch 6</b> might
                appeal to some, the relatively bargain price of the Apple Watch SE will be much more tempting to others.</p>
                <p>That’s where this guide comes in, as we’ve not only ranked the available Apple Watches, we’ve also detailed what makes
                each one stand out.</p>
                <p>Then, further down we’ve taken a look at the straps, sizes, prices, colors, and even the available apps and watch faces,
                so this article should cover everything you need to know.</p>
